# Handwritten Digit Classifier

This repository contains a [notebook](https://github.com/jessedeans/NN_Handwritten_Digit_Classifier/blob/main/Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb) that uses machine learning to build models to predict handwritten numbers. In the notebook I explore the effectiveness of a k-nearest neighbor(KNN) model and a three feedforward neural networks (with one to three hidden layers) at classifying handwritten digits. 

The data comes from Scikit-learn. The library contains a number of datasets pre-loaded with within the namespace of sklearn.datasets.
